Monaco-Tools
============
DO NOT ADD MONACO CONTENT TO THIS REPOSITORY
All scripts should use filepath.txt to get Monaco's filepath, and use that content when image or level content is required from Monaco's instal.

To set up, filepath.txt may need to be edited with the filepath to your Monaco installation.

If you wish to create a new tool, it should be in its own directory.
