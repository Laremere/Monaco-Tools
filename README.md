Monaco-Tools
============
DO NOT ADD MONACO CONTENT TO THIS REPOSITORY.  
All scripts should use the function filepath() in Utils to get Monaco's filepath, and use that content when image or level content is required from Monaco's install.

I'm currently in the middle of rewriting the level sub-package.  If you want reference to code that works, check out the Mlevel file in the old_version folder.

If you wish to create a new tool, it should be its own subpackage.
